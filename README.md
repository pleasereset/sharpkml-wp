SharpKML for Windows Phone
==========================

A port of the Sharp KML library (http://sharpkml.codeplex.com/) and it's dependency library (http://dotnetzip.codeplex.com/) for Windows Phone.

Included an usage sample and helpers to draw on a native Nokia Map control.

Notes : 
- As-is, the project is compiling for Windows Phone 8 as the sample is using the new map control, but there nothing should get in the way of compiling the project for Windows Phone 7
- The port of DotNetZip is incomplete and limited to the features used by SharpKML

The port and its dependencies are released under the Ms-PL licenses, with attribution.
